# Best Practices and Productivity in Programming

**Employing best practices enhances code quality, aids logical reasoning, and increases productivity!**

1. **Indentation is Mandatory**
   - Do not use auto-indentation as a crutch. The correct approach is to indent as the code is being constructed. This also assists our brain in thinking structurally.

        move 
        if then 
           compute... 
        else
        end-if

2. **Variable, Function, Procedure, and Parameter Names**
   - Names should be precise and immediately convey the central idea. In other words, they should get straight to the point.
   - Don't be afraid of long names. If your function or parameter requires an extensive name to truly represent what it stands for, that's what should be done.

3. **Comments**
   - Create comments to explain what a particular piece of code does.
   - The best way to create comments is to do so even before writing the code, describing the step-by-step process the code should follow to achieve the result, and then "fill in" this step-by-step with the code.

4. **Prefer Readable Code (Easy to Read) Over "Less Verbose" Code**
   - Source code written in a programming language is meant for humans, not the computer. The compiler will translate the code for the computer.

5. **Use and Utilize Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, and IDE Auto-Complete**
   - This will help prevent typing errors and increase productivity.

6. **Don't Wait to Test Until the End**
   - Test the program with each small functionality that is created, and if necessary, test between small changes.
